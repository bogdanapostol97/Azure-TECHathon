# Azure-TECHathon
My work for the 2020 Microsoft Azure TECHathon for students. I created a simple python hello-world app and containerized it using Docker. The app was deployed in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using Azure DevOps. Basically I learned how to use Docker and Kubernetes efficiently.
